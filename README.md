# Quarantine Bingo

This is a simple app using React to create a BINGO game. The live site can be found by following this [link](https://quarantinebingo.netlify.app/).

If you want to shuffle the BINGO balls you can run the **bingo_shuffle.js** by running `node bingo_shuffle.js` in the CLI. This will console log out the balls in a random way each time or you can use the SHUFFLE! button on the main page of the UI.

Enjoy!
